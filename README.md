# Fibonacci

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

**F0 = 0, F1 = 1**

and

**Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2**
for n > 1.

The beginning of the sequence is thus:

    ( 0 ) , 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , 144 , â€¦
